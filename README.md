# Balloonatic-Phase-2-nhanm1
 Balloonatic Asylum
This project is about developing a website which is used to sell balloons .
I developed this project using Nodejs as backend and ExpressJS framework.
The website consists of basic functionalities like user registration, user signin . I have used express-session for handling of session when user login to the website.
I have used JSON file to store user details and also the product details since in this phase we are not allowed to use mongodb.
Through EJS loaded all the products from the JSON file usinh a for loop.
